        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <h3>Browned butter (if using)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Add 12oz butter to a sauce pan over medium heat and melt.</li>
          <li>Heat and stir butter until it starts to bubble off the water in it</li>
          <li>Cook butter until the milk solids start to brown and smell like toffee</li>
          <li>Browned butter can turn to burnt butter very quickly so watch closely!</li>
          <li>Remove from heat and pour into a bowl surrounded by ice to halt cooking</li>
          <li>This should yield about 8oz browned butter depending on moisture content of original butter</li>
          </ol><h3>Cookie dough (cookie method)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Add room temp butter to a mixer and cream with white and brown sugar until fluffy</li>
          <li>Add vanilla extract and eggs, one at a time, to mixer, and combine. Make sure each egg is incorporated before adding the next.</li>
          <li>In a medium bowl, combine flour, salt, backing soda and powder and mix to combine</li>
          <li>Add the dry ingredients to the mixer a little at a time and fully incorporate.</li>
          </ol><h3>Cookie dough (biscuit method)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>In a food processor, combine flour, salt, backing soda and powder and pulse to combine</li>
          <li>Add chilled butter and pulse until the mixture is pebbly</li>
          <li>Add white and brown sugar and pulse a couple times to combine</li>
          <li>Add vanilla extract and eggs, one at a time, and combine. Make sure each egg is incorporated before adding the next.</li>
          </ol><h3>Cookies</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Make dough using one of the above methods</li>
          <li>Roll the dough into 50g balls and place in a ziploc bag</li>
          <li>Place the dough balls in the fridge and allow to rest for at least 2 hours.</li>
          <li>Preheat oven to 350</li>
          <li>Place chilled dough balls on a parchment lined cookies sheet and put straight into the oven</li>
          <li>Bake for 18-ish minutes</li>
          <li>Allow the sheet pan to cool completely before putting the next batch of cookies on the on it so it doesn&#39;t start to melt the butter in the dough before the cookies go into the oven</li>
          </ol>
