# Barbacoa Beef

## Ingredients

- 1 tsp olive oil
- 2 lbs beef (chuck, stew meat, or tri-tip)
- 2 tbsp minced garlic
- 2 canned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce stemmed, cored, seeded, and minced
- 1 tbsp paprika
- 1 tbsp ground cumin
- 2 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp ground black pepper
- 2 tbsp adobo sauce from the can
- 3 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 2 tbsp lime juice
- 2 tbsp regular or low-sodium soy sauce or gluten-free tamari sauce
- 3/4 cup beef broth

## Procedure

- Cut beef into 2" chunks
- Saute on high to get good sear on a few faces of the beef chunks
- Stir in the garlic and minced chipotle until aromatic, just a few seconds.
- Stir in the paprika, cumin, onion powder, and pepper. Warm by stirring a few times, then stir in the adobo sauce, vinegar, lime juice, and soy or tamari sauce. Scrape up any browned bits on the potâ€™s bottom and turn off the heat.
- Pressure cook on high for 35 minutes
- Let pressure release naturally (about 30 minutes)
- Use two forks to shred the beef right in the pot. Stir it into the sauce and set the pot aside for 2 to 3 minutes so that the meat continues to absorb the juices. Serve warm.
