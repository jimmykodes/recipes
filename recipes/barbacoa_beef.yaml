ingredients:
  - items:
      - 2 chipotle chiles in adobo from a can, minced
      - 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
      - 1/2 cup low-sodium beef broth
      - 1/4 cup salsa verde
      - 6 garlic cloves
      - 3 pounds boneless chuck roast trimmed of excess fat and cut into 4 equal-sized chunks
      - 2 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
      - 1 teaspoon pepper
      - 2 teaspoon ground cumin
      - 4 bay leaves
      - 1 tablespoon dried oregano
procedure:
  - items:
      - In the bottom of an instant pot, combine the adobo chiles, apple cider vinegar, broth, salsa verde, garlic, and stir until well combined.
      - Season the chuck roast on all sides with the salt, pepper, cumin, oregano and nestle into the sauce in the InstantPot. Add bay leaves.
      - Cover and ensure that the InstantPot is properly sealed. Cook on Manual High Pressure for 45 minutes.
      - Natural release pressure for 15 minutes. Manually release the remaining pressure, if any.
      - Using tongs, transfer the cook roast to a sheet pan and using two forks, shred the meat. Return the shredded meat to the sauce in the pot and toss until well coated. Let rest in the sauce for at least 10 minutes to really allow the sauce to coat the shredded beef all over and soak in.
