procedure:
  - name: Cooking the Meat
    items:
      - Cook the ground beef until mostly cooked through, breaking up as you go
      - Set aside in a bowl lined with a paper towel to drain excess fat
  - name: Building the Sauce
    items:
      - Add onions to the pan (adding any fat if needed) and cook until softened
      - Add tomato paste and garlic, cooking until the tomato paste caramelizes a bit and the garlic is fragrant
      - Add the diced tomatoes and tomato sauce to pan before the garlic burns
      - Scrape up any bits on the bottom of the pan
      - Return the meat to the sauce and combine
  - name: Cooking the Pasta
    items:
      - Bring water to a boil and cook the pasta for half the time denoted on the package
      - When the pasta is half cooked, reserve a cup of pasta water and then drain the par-cooked pasta
  - name: Final Assembly
    items:
      - Add the beans and the pasta to the sauce to heat the beans and finish cooking the noodles
      - If the sauce is too thick, use reserved pasta water to thin (it will thicken as the noodles cook and absorb water, so keep an eye on it)
      - Once the noodles are cooked through, mix in the cheese
      - Once the cheese has melted, serve
      - Top with optional toppings as desired
