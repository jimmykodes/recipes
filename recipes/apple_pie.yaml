  - name: Prep the apples
    items:
      - Peel and slice the apples
      - Mix 1/4 cup white sugar w/ 1 tsp salt and combine with the apples
      - Place apples in a collinder to "deflate" for at least an hour
  - name: Make the crust
    items:
      - Add salt and sugar to flour and mix to combine
      - Add butter and shortening to flour and rub/cut in the fat until the mixture becomes pebbly.
        Some pea sized chucks of fat should still remain.
      - Add liquid to the mixture, starting with about a half a cup and adding a tablespoon at a time
        until a dough forms.
      - Split the dough into two roughly equal balls and wrap in plastic wrap. Pop in the fridge for
        dough to hydrate
  - name: Make the filling
    items:
      - In a small bowl whisk together the cinnamon, nutmeg, ground ginger, flour, brown sugar and 
        remaining 1/4 cup white sugar
      - Once apples have "deflated", transfer to a large bowl. Save the drained liquid
      - Add the small bowl of spices to the apples and stir to combine
  - name: Assemble the pie
    items:
      - Take one dough ball from the fridge and roll out to a couple inches in diameter larger than
        the pie dish
      - Transfer the dough to the pie pan by rolling on to the rolling pin and unrolling over the dish
      - Take care to lift and drop the pie dough into the corners of the pie pan (do not stretch the dough)
      - Use a fork to dock the bottom crust (poke holes for air to escape)
      - Add the apples to the pie pan (either dumping in chaotically or by methodically spiralling)
      - To the drained apple liquid add the optional hard cider and/or lime juice and pour over the apples
      - Add the optional butter on top the apples, cut into small chunks
      - Take the remaining dough ball and roll to just larger than the pie dish
      - Transfer on top of the filling again using the rolling pin
      - Crimp edges of the crust, cut some pattern of vents into the top crust, and sprinkle with optional
        cinnamon-sugar
  - name: Baking the pie
    items:
      - Preheat oven to 400
      - Optionally include a pizza stone on the bottom rack of the oven
      - Once oven and optional pizza stone have reached temp, place the pie dish (in a cookie sheet)
        on the pizza stone (or just the bottom rack of the oven if not using the stone)
      - Cook for 20 minutes
      - Reduce heat to 350 and move the pie to the middle rack of the oven. If using the pizza stone,
        it can be removed from the oven.
      - Cook another 20-30 minutes until filling is bubbly and crust is nicely browned
      - If the edges of the pie start to brown too quickly, tent with foil
